### My name is Rafael Medina
I’m a town guy maker living in Santo Domingo with a passion for art and technology.

I’m pretty critical of software. I think software should be enjoyable to use and affect the world in a positive manner. That’s unfortunately not quite the world we live in. But I still deeply love software — I think it’s one of the most powerful inventions of humankind. And I can’t help think that we could do so much more if we held ourselves to higher standards.

I’m a bit of a hippie, a bit of a capitalist, and a hyperbolic crazy person in between. But you know, maybe that’s just the side effects of working in software and loving art.
